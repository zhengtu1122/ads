# There's a lot of interest in tinygrad lately. Here's some guidelines for contributing:

Bugfixes are the best and always welcome! Like this one.
If you don't understand the code you are changing, don't change it!
All code golf PRs will be closed, but conceptual cleanups are great.
Features are welcome. Though if you are adding a feature, you need to include tests.
Improving test coverage is great, with reliable non brittle tests.
